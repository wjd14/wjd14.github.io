      <p>
	First they ignore you,<br>
	then they laugh at you,<br>
	then they fight you,<br>
	then you win.<br>
	- Ghandi
      </p>

      <p>
	….unwavering commitment to virtue over pleasure and to tranquillity over above happiness… - Marcus Aurelius
      </p>

      <p>Good habits formed at youth make all the difference. - Aristotle</p>

      <p>There are, for example, economic and political interests that would be better served by allowing the bulk of a semiliterate population to entertain itself with the magic of visual computer games, to use and be used by computers without understanding. - Neil Postman</p>

      <p>But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, - Matthew 6:3</p>

      <p>Everyone thinks of changing the world, but nobody thinks of changing himself. - Leo Tolstoy</p>

      <p>Yes— I was perhaps an egotist in youth, but I soon found it made me morbid to think too much about myself. - F. Scott Fitzgerald</p>

      <p>Nonetheless, character—the willingness to accept responsibility for one's own life—is the source from which self-respect springs. - Joan Didion</p>

      <p>What is a Man,<br>
	If his chief good and market of his time<br>
	Be but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more.<br>
	Sure, he that made us with such large discourse,<br>
	Looking before and after, gave us not<br>
	That capability and god-like reason<br>
	To fust in us unused.<br>
	- William Shakespeare
	</p>
      <p>“But you were always a good man of business, Jacob," faltered Scrooge, who now began to apply this to himself.
	Business!' cried the Ghost, wringing its hands again. "Mankind was my business; charity, mercy, forbearance, and benevolence, were, all, my business. The deals of my trade were but a drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of my business!” - Charles Dickens</p>


      <p>Technology isn’t bad. If you know what you want in life, technology can help you get it. But if you don’t know what you want in life, it will be all too easy for technology to shape your aims for you and take control of your life. Especially as technology gets better at understanding humans, you might increasingly find yourself serving it, instead of it serving you. Have you seen those zombies who roam the streets with their faces glued to their smartphones? Do you think they control the technology, or does the technology control them? - Yuval Noah Harari</p>

      <p>Do or do not, there is no try. -Yoda</p>

      <p>Scientists discover the world that exists; engineers create the world that never was. - Theodore Von Karman</p>


      <p>Do the best you can, with what you have, where you are. - Theodore Roosevelt</p>

      <p>I have never looked upon ease and happiness as ends in themselves -- this critical basis I call the ideal of a pigsty. The ideals that have lighted my way, and time after time have given me new courage to face life cheerfully, have been Kindness, Beauty, and Truth. Without the sense of kinship with men of like mind, without the occupation with the objective world, the eternally unattainable in the field of art and scientific endeavors, life would have seemed empty to me. The trite objects of human efforts -- possessions, outward success, luxury -- have always seemed to me contemptible. - Albert Einstein</p>


      <p>Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not: nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not: the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. The slogan Press On! has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race. - Calvin Coolidge</p>

      <p>It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat. - Theodore Roosevelt</p>

      <p>The most difficult thing is the decision to act, the rest is merely tenacity. The fears are paper tigers. You can do anything you decide to do. You can act to change and control your life; and the procedure, the process is its own reward. - Amelia Earhart</p>

      <p>It is not because things are difficult that we do not dare, it is because we do not dare that they are difficult. - Seneca</p>

      <p>Throw me to the wolves and I will return leading the pack. - Seneca</p>

      <p>Success is peace of mind which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you did your best to become the best you are capable of becoming. - John Wooden</p>

      <p>Inaction breeds doubt and fear. Action breeds confidence and courage. If you want to conquer fear, do not sit home and think about it. Go out and get busy. - Dale Carnegie</p>

      <p>Every man has his secret sorrows which the world knows not; and often times we call a man cold when he is only sad. - Henry Wadsworth Longfellow </p>
